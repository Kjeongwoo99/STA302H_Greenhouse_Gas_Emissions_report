## Overview

The primary goal of this assignment is to analyze and understand the patterns, trends and implications of the historical data of the greenhouse gas emissions in the world from 1990 to 2020. This analysis sets the road maps for both developed and developing countries to meet the level of GHG emissions targets to meet the Paris Agreement in which nations have agreed to limit global warming below 2, preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.
